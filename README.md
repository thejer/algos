# Data Structure and Algorithm Problem Practices (Python)

### A repository of a few of my DSA practice Solutions in python. These solutions are from:

> * [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
> * [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

### One thing to note is 3 of these solutions were from external contributors, they are:

> * Bad Segment by [David Asamu](https://github.com/phvash)
> * Max Substring by [Deji Abdullah](https://github.com/dejii)
> * Min After Removals by [Tolu Fakiyesi](https://github.com/tolufakiyesi)

### The repository will be updated periodically as I solve more problems.
